4.7
Thermal cutoff switch
Each APCQ capacitor bank cubicle includes a temperature-sensitive switch that trips the
controller power supply (hence RVC/RVT controller will be off) in case of over
temperature above 60°C (or 140°F) inside the enclosure. In such event, all the capacitors
are switched off while fans keep running. Thermal cutoff switch automatically closes
when temperature goes down to normal conditions.
DANGER
When the thermal protection switches on, RVC/RVT controller is off but the
capacitor bank is still connected to the power supplies. See safety instructions and
wait 5 minutes before the opening.
